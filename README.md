## Bubble Sort
**Best-Case Scenario:**
* The best-case scenario for bubble sort is a completely sorted list in ascending order because bubble sort won't need to make any swaps for this list and will traverse it once for it to be considered completely sorted.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
* The worst-case scenario for bubble sort is a list that is in reverse order. Each traversal by bubble sort will only order one element at a time, forcing the method to make many passes.

## Selection Sort
**Best-Case Scenario:**
* All cases for selection sort will have the same number of passes/swaps regardless of the positioning of the elements. Therefore there is no best case.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
* For the same reason as the best-case scenario, selection sort will have no worst-case.

## Insertion Sort
**Best-Case Scenario:**
* The best-case scenario for insertion sort is an already sorted list in ascending order since insertion sort will have to make no swaps and traverse the list once.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
* The worst-case scenario for insertion sort is, like bubble sort, a list in reverse order. Each element will have to be "walked" many times to reach its place in the sorted region of the list, making it the worst-case scenario for insertion sort.
