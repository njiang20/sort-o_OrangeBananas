## Bubble Sort
**Best-Case Scenario:**
* The best-case scenario for bubble sort is O(n^2) because even if a greater value is found while iterating through the ArrayList, bubblesort continues iterating.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
* The best-case scenario for bubble sort is O(n^2) because


## Selection Sort
**Best-Case Scenario:**
* All cases for selection sort will have the same number of passes/swaps regardless of the positioning of the elements. Therefore there is no best case.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
* For the same reason as the best-case scenario, selection sort will have no worst-case.

## Insertion Sort
**Best-Case Scenario:**
* The best-case scenario for insertion sort is an already sorted list in ascending order since insertion sort will have to make no swaps and traverse the list once.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
* The worst-case scenario for insertion sort is, like bubble sort, a list in reverse order. Each element will have to be "walked" many times to reach its place in the sorted region of the list, making it the worst-case scenario for insertion sort.

| Sort Type | # Passes | # Comparisons | # Swaps |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Bubble | 9 | 45 | 23 |
| Selection | 9 | 45 | 9 |
| Insertion | 9 | 29 | 23 |
