QCCS:

BUB-QA:
 * q0: If a pass requires no swaps, what do you know?
 * a0: This means that the array is already in increasing order.
 * q1: After pass p, what do you know?
 * a1: After pass p, we know that the first p values are correct.
 * q2: How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
 * a2: Th number of passes needed to completely sort is p - 1 passes.

SEL-QA:
* q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
* a0: n - 1 passes are needed to sort n elements.
* q1: What do you know after pass p?
* a1: After pass p, we know p elements have been completely sorted.
* q2: How do you know if sorted?
* a2: n - 1 passes have occured.
* q3: What does a pass boil down to?
* a3: A pass is recursive. It finds the smallest in an array, the next smallest, and etc.

INS-QA:
* q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
* a0: n - 1 passes
* q1: What do you know after pass p?
* a1: The element that was at index p are now in the sorted region.
* q2: How will you know when sorted?
* a2: n - 1 passes have occured.
* q3: What constitues a pass?
* a3: When one element at a time is "walked" into the sorted region separated by the partition.
* q4: What must you track?
* a4: The index at which the partition is, which increments the size of the sorted region by one.
